### Project Features

- PARA Methodology:
    - Manage Projects, Areas, Resources, and Tasks for long-term organization.
- Universal Tag System:
    - Apply tags across different models (Projects, Areas, Tasks, Notes) using GenericForeignKey for cross-model
      tagging.
- Custom Search Filters:
    - Filter tasks and resources using Django Filter with support for multiple fields (title, description).
- Project Dashboards:
    - Display the latest entries for Projects, Areas, Resources, Notes, and Tasks on a dashboard.
- Comments with Generic Relations:
    - Add and manage comments across different models using a generic comment system.
- Task Archiving:
    - Archive any entity (Project, Area, Resource, or Task) with an is_archived flag.
- Image Uploads:
    - Upload cover images for projects and resources with automatic resizing for consistent visuals.
- Integrated PostgreSQL Database:
    - Seamless database configuration with PostgreSQL for better performance and scaling.

### Technologies Used

- Backend Framework: Django 5.1.1
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Bootstrap-based templates
- ORM & Querying: Django ORM, Django Filters
- Image Handling: Pillow for resizing and handling cover images
- Admin Interface: Custom Django Admin for all models

### How to Use PARAplanner

1. Organize Tasks using PARA:

    - Projects: Manage specific, time-bound initiatives.
    - Areas: Oversee broad, ongoing areas of responsibility.
    - Resources: Keep track of tools, information, and reference materials.
    - Notes: Add personal notes connected to Projects, Areas, or Resources.
    - Tasks: Manage your own tasks with possibility to bound it to different areas, projects, resources.
2. Tagging System:
    - Apply tags across all entities for easy filtering and searching.

3. Comments and Discussions:
    - Add comments to various models to track discussions and thoughts.

4. Dashboard Overview:
    - Monitor the latest entries and active tasks directly on the dashboard.

5. Archiving:
    - Mark old or inactive tasks, projects, or areas as archived to keep the workspace clean.

### Getting Started

1. Prerequisites
    - Python 3.10+
    - PostgreSQL
    - Pipenv (or pip for package management)
    - Git
2. Clone the Repository
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd PARAplanner
    ```
3. Install Dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

- Create a new PostgreSQL database.
- Update your settings.py with the following configuration:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': '<your-database-name>',
            'USER': '<your-username>',
            'PASSWORD': '<your-password>',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```

5. Apply Migrations
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6. Create a Superuser:
    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
7. Run the local Development Server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
   (!) Access the project at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Project Models and Optimizations

1. Base Models
    - BaseParaModel (Abstract): Contains shared fields like title, description, author, is_archived.
    - Project, Area, Resource, Note, Task: Derived from the base model to handle different aspects of PARA.
2. Comment System
    - Comment: Supports comments on any model using GenericForeignKey.
    - Includes timestamps for creation and updates, and an active status to mark visibility.
3. Tags System
    - ParaTag: Tags with a Many-to-Many relationship across all entities.
4. Common logic for creating comments, PARA-elements etc. optimized for "reusability"
in whole project just by **"import <function-name>"**.
    
    **_Example of comment utils:_**
    ```python
    def handle_edit_request(request, obj, get_context_data_func):
   
        comment_id = request.POST.get('comment_id')
        comment = get_comment(comment_id, obj, type(obj))
    
        if user_is_author(comment, request.user):
            context = get_context_data_func()
            context.update({
                'editing_comment': comment,
                'comment_form': CommentForm(initial={'text': comment.text})
            })
            return context
        return {}  # Optional: Handle unauthorized access
   
   class AreaDetailView(DetailView, LoginRequiredMixin):
        ...
   
        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            ...

        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            self.object = self.get_object()

            if 'submit_comment' in request.POST:
                return handle_comment_creation(request, self.object, self.redirect_url)

            elif 'edit_comment' in request.POST:
                return handle_comment_editing(request, self.object, self.redirect_url)

            elif 'edit' in request.POST:
                context = handle_edit_request(request, self.object, self.get_context_data)
                if context:
                return self.render_to_response(context)

            elif 'delete_comment' in request.POST:
                return handle_comment_deletion(request, self.object, self.redirect_url)

            return self.get(request, *args, **kwargs)
    ``` 
    
### Admin Management

- Admin Interface Customizations
    - All models are registered in the admin panel with custom configurations for better management.
    - Projects, Areas, Resources: Display related tags, authors, and deadlines in the list view.
    - Tags and Comments: Filterable by related fields (authors, status, depending).

_Example admin setup:_

```python
class BaseParaAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Base admin configuration for models with similar admin behavior."""

    list_display = (
        'title',
        '...',
    )
    list_filter = (
        'title',
        '...',
    )
    search_fields = ('title', 'description', 'author__username')
    ordering = ('-created', 'priority', 'deadline')
    autocomplete_fields = ['tags']
    date_hierarchy = 'created'
    list_per_page = 20
    readonly_fields = ('id',)
    prepopulated_fields = {'title': ('title',)}

    def get_tags(self, obj):
        """Retrieve and display related tags as a comma-separated string."""

        return ", ".join([tag.title for tag in obj.tags.all()])

    get_tags.short_description = 'Tags'


# –ù–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ–º—Å—è –æ—Ç –±–∞–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∞ –¥–ª—è –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–µ–π

@admin.register(Area)
class AreaAdmin(BaseParaAdmin):
    """Admin configuration for the Area model."""
    pass

... ... ...
```

    - Create RESTful APIs to integrate with external apps or enable mobile access.
- Task Dependencies:
    - Allow tasks to depend on each other with automated notifications.
- Notification System:
    - Implement email or in-app notifications for task deadlines and updates.
- Chat System:
    - Implement chat application to improve communication between owners and users.
